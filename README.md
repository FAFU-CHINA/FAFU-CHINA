When it comes to fragrance, we immediately think of fragrant plants, such as flowers, but they don't bloom all year round. In the age of the Internet, it's easy to see a flower, but not so easy to smell it. So, we were thinking about a question, how do you smell a flower anytime, anywhere?

The biochemical pathways that produce aromas are not unique to plants; they may be just one or two enzymes at the end of the pathways. By heterologous expression of these enzymes in microorganisms, it is possible to make them produce flavoring substances at anytime and anywhere.

According to literatures, we found the MVA pathway in yeast, and yeast enrichment of IPP and DMAPP can be realized by overexpressing rate-limiting enzymes in some pathways. With these two precursors, we only need to heterologous express one or two related genes in plants to be able to use yeast to produce floral fragrances.
