                We verified the basic function of BBa_K3127998, and we also found ways to extend the function of
                BBa_K3127998 in the literature, hoping to help future teams to build more stable photogenetic systems.
                We also summarized a year experiences and lessons from the development team, and in accordance with the
                category proposed many have reference value, hope for the future team.

            <h3>1、Engineering Success</h3>
            <p><a
                    href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Engineering">https://2021.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Engineering</a>
            </p>
            <p>We successfully solved some of the problems in the project, including the stability of the co-culture
                system and the photogenetic system in E. coli. Due to limited time, we could not fully verify the
                components of the photogenetic system used in yeast (BBa_K3732000~ BBa_K3732003), but we theoretically
                verified the feasibility of Parts to predict their functions by using the model. Combined with the
                literature knowledge and the experimental results, we already know the way of our project. We have also
                noticed the problem of our project. Aromatic substances are easily transformed into each other, and
                further optimization of metabolic pathways is needed to achieve the enrichment of single aromatic
                substances.</p>
            <h3>2、Collaboration</h3>

            </p>
            <p>We have conducted experiments, HP, modeling and reached cooperation with FZU-China, Tongji-China,
                SZPT-China, SZ-SHD, NWU-China-A, ZJU-China, HZAU-China, CAU-China and other schools.</p>
            <h3>3、Human Practices</h3>
            <p><a

            </p>
            <p>Before carrying out HP activities, we consulted experts for relevant information and studied relevant
                laws and regulations to ensure the correct implementation of human practices. We consulted a lot of
                relevant literature and interviewed many experts to constantly improve our project. We also conducted
                surveys on campus and in the community, asking the public about their smell preferences and approval of
                the program.</p>
            <h3>4、Proposed Implementation</h3>

            </p>
            <p>
                Our project designs a photoinduced microbial culture system. We also designed a microbiome night light
                to bring our project to life. With the change of light intensity, people can smell the dynamic change of
                aroma throughout the day. Strains of linalool is contained in the production of fragrance, it can help
                alleviate the negative emotions of people. We hope to bring different experience to those who love
                aromatherapy.

            <h3>1、Integrated Human Practices</h3>
            <p><a
                    href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Human_Practices">https://2021.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Human_Practices</a>
            </p>
            <p>From learning how to properly carry out human practice work, to collecting opinions from experts and the
                public and improving the project, to the entrepreneurship and promotion of the project, human practice
                work is implemented in our project. Through a large number of social investigations, we have fully
                understood the market background of spices, and also adopted the opinions of many people and experts to
                fully consider the safety and practicality of the project. We also visited factories and communities,
                and with their input, we improved our design to meet their needs. Based on the results of human
                practice, we also designed a microbial-scented night light, and learned about the follow-up development
                of the project from relevant government departments. All in all, our HP work is relatively complete and
                can be used as a reference for future iGEM teams.</p>
            <h3>2、Project Modeling</h3>
            <p><a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Model">https://2021.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Model</a></p>
            <p>First, we decompose the MVA pathway into a single elementary reaction according to the kinetic-based
                biochemical reaction model and construct a series of constant-coefficient differential equations to
                predict the relationship between the production of each aroma substance in a single cell and time.
                Secondly, we established an oscillator model to study the steady-state process of the microbial cell
                separation cycle. Use the response surface model based on BP neural network to explore and optimize the
                conditions of the co-cultivation system for the stable existence of E. coli and Saccharomyces
                cerevisiae, and help the Tongji_China team to support this model. Based on the conformational changes of
                Jα and helix in LOV2 under light and dark conditions, we use the signal node network model, use the
                BE-ABC optimization algorithm, and the Alphafold2 deep learning algorithm to predict the structure of
                the protein, and a series of related bioinformatics analysis. Finally, we also performed physical and
                mathematical simulations of the aroma emitted by the night light.</p>
            <h3>3、Proof of Concept</h3>
            <p><a
                    href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Proof_Of_Concept">https://2021.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Proof_Of_Concept</a>
            </p>
            <p>Our products do not require aseptic operations to mix the bacteria with the culture medium to start the
                fermentation system. On the other hand, our equipment is very simple, only need night light and
                fermentation tank to achieve all the desired functions. Our philosophy is to reduce complexity to
                simplicity, not to make buyers think they are buying large-scale laboratory equipment. This design makes
                the transportation and use of the product very convenient. Due to the cover made of the filter membrane,
                the microorganisms in the fermentor will not leak from the fermentor to the environment, and the
                external microorganisms will not enter the fermentor, thus avoiding the use of antibiotics and strains
                with resistance genes. Nowadays, aromatherapy has entered the lives of the general public, hoping to
                bring a new and different experience to those who love aromatherapy.</p>
            <h3>4、partnership</h3>
            <p><a
                    href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Partnership">https://2021.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Partnership</a>
            </p>
            <p>Due to the epidemic, our cooperation with other schools is mainly online. After the exchange meeting in
                China, we have reached a long-term cooperative relationship with FZU-China and Tongji_China. We have
                maintained close cooperation since the beginning of the project, and have had close communication with
                FZU-China, Tongji_China and so on.</p>
            <h3>5、Education and Communication</h3>
            <p><a
                    href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Communication">https://2021.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Communication</a>
            </p>
            <p>We carry out educational activities in kindergartens, elementary schools, middle schools, universities
                and other platforms. We adopt different teaching models for different groups of people, or directly or
                indirectly introduce synthetic biology and its ideas. We also cooperated with companies to hold
                exhibitions related to our projects, and to popularize the knowledge of smell to the public, encouraging
                them to learn about plants and the biological knowledge behind them. In addition, we also publish our
                works on many online platforms, such as tweets, videos, etc., hoping to let more people know about
                synthetic biology and our projects. Every educational activity is carefully planned. We will carefully
                prepare the PPT and manuscripts needed for the speech, and make posters and brochures. Materials related
                to educational activities, as well as electronic backups, can be found by the masses on the
                corresponding network platform and further study. Fragrance is a well-known and talked-about topic. We
                use this as an entry point to encourage the people to use synthetic biology to create their own
                fragrance.</p>
